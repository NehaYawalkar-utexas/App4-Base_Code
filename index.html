Brief Description of Goal of Code:
This program asks a series of diagnosis questions to asses a person experiencing allergy and cold symptoms. 
By compiling yes or no responses, the code will determine how likely each of the diagnoses are in terms of percentages. 



Known Issues:
Results button was appearing on front page, not results page (resolved)
Results would not appear upon click of "Show Results" button (resolved)
"Show Results" button was overlapping with header section (resolved)

		/**
		in-depth explanation of this function:
		
		originally, there is a paragraph on the results page called "results" that is completely empty.
		it is empty because we don't have any results at first.
		as the user answers the questions, the data gets collected in the two counter variables for allergy and cold.
		by the time the user reaches the results page, all the data has been collected. now results can be calculated.
		clicking the button "show results" on the results page will call a function called resultsPercentages(). 
		This function takes the collected data from the counters and calculates the results. 
		In this program, it calculates what percentage of answers refers to each diagnosis.
		once these results have been calculated, the function prints the results into the previously empty paragraph.
		the way it does this is by directly editing the content of the paragraph. 
		as a result, once the button "Show Results" has been pressed, the user will be able to see their percentages appear under the button.
		
		**/
		
		var resultText = document.getElementById("results"); // this will call into action the paragraph titled "results", located on page 5
		var allergyPercent = (allergy_count/4)*100; // this calculates the allergy percentage
		var coldPercent = (cold_count/4)*100; // this calculates the cold percentage
		resultText.innerHTML = "Percentage of allergies =" + allergyPercent + "%" + "<br> Percentage of cold =" + coldPercent + "%";
		// this function edits the variable resultText, which refers to the paragraph titled "results" located on page 5. 
		// the page updates to reflect the results aka relative percentages of each diagnosis type

	<!-- in-depth explanation of page layout:
Each assessment question is stored on its own "page". "Page" is a type of element used to organize this website.
This website uses "div" tag to separate the content of each "page" into sections.
All "page" elements belong to the same "class" and thus share certain common attributes, such as style and color scheme.
The "id" of each "page" is unique, and is used to navigate through the website and access each specific page.
The title of each page is formatted using the <h1> tag, which makes it look big like a header.
The <p> tag is used to display normal text in paragraph form. 
<a> tag is used for links. Within the <a> tag includes several additional instructions. 
The "href" tag describes where the link should direct the user to. 
In these examples, href is always directing the user to a different page within the website, as dictated by the "#(page)" that follows it.
The onclick command is defined using Javascript. onclick causes an action to happen upon clicking the link.
In these examples, onclick is used to add a tally to its designated counter variable, allergy or cold, which are both defined in the script code.
In the <a> tag, there is also a class defined as: class="w3-btn w3-grey w3-round". 
This class makes the links on each page appear like clickable buttons that are grey and round.
The text located between the front and back <a> tags are the text that the link appears as. These words represent the words on the clickable buttons. 
This same format is copied for all pages. Only the addresses of the links and the functions of the buttons change based on the purpose of each page. 
These functions and addresses are specified line by line in the code comments below.
